In this assignment, I learned how to compare two different strings, how to check the number of characters in a character string, and also learn how to copy a string to another string.

The "findContactIndex" function is benefits for my source code, as there are several options in the contact management system. "update contact", "delete contact" and "search contact", all these three options need to find the index for contact first. If you can't find the contact, there is meaningless for the update, delete or search. With this function, I don't need to write the same code whenever I need to find a contact.

The "getTenDigitPhone" also helped in source code. It checks the user's input if there are all digital, as the program is asking for the phone number, it has to be digit if the input contains letters or other operators, it is useless. Also, I can save time to write the same code every time when I need to check the user's input.

I would like to load/save the contact information from/to a text data file. Using the file seems easier to input the information. We can use one command like "fprintf" to input all the information of a contact. There is no need to separate into different steps, for example, ask the user to input name then address then number. With the data file, we can put all that information in one command and write it into the file. The second reason is that we can store the information in that file. Before we learn the data file, everything we input for the program will gone when we close the window, with the data file we can store the data in secondary memory. If we need to change or read anything from the file, just open it without re-entering anything.
